# Changelog

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Dynamic UI Generation** — Agent tools render rich interactive components inline in chat:
  - `ComponentSpec` protocol: data_table, info_card_grid, badge_list, status_list, key_value, chart
  - `AgentComponentRenderer` maps specs to existing primitives (DataTable, InfoCard, Badge, MetricsChart)
  - `MarkdownRenderer` for text responses (headers, bold, code blocks, lists) — no npm dependency
  - 4 tools enhanced: `list_pods`, `list_deployments`, `get_events`, `top_pods_by_restarts` return structured tables
  - Auto-colored status/severity columns in rendered tables
  - New WebSocket event type: `component` with tool-emitted specs
- **Cancel/Stop button** — Red square button (or Escape key) aborts running agent queries, saves partial response
- **Edit last message** — Pencil button loads last user message back into input for re-submission
- **Build logs** — Uses OpenShift Build API (`/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/.../builds/{name}/log`) instead of Pod API

### Fixed
- **Browser memory/performance** — Streaming deltas batched via `requestAnimationFrame` instead of per-token re-renders; `MessageBubble` wrapped in `React.memo`; message history capped at 100 in memory / 50 persisted
- **SSRF IPv6 bypass** — Dev proxy helmrepo endpoint now blocks IPv6 loopback, IPv4-mapped, unique local, and link-local addresses
- **Helm values** — Added `agent.serviceName` default to prevent template rendering error
- **Build log 404s** — Build view was fetching pod logs for build names; now uses correct Build API endpoint

### Stats
- **1472 tests** across 97 test files
- **17 views**, 45+ routes
- **54 agent tools** with 4 returning rich UI component specs
- **0 npm CVEs**, all Red Hat UBI images

  - Chat interface at `/agent` with SRE and Security modes
  - WebSocket streaming with thinking indicators, tool execution badges
  - Confirmation gates for write operations with plain English descriptions, risk levels, keyboard shortcuts (Y/N)
  - Context-aware "Ask Agent" action on every resource detail page
  - Namespace-aware quick prompts that adapt to selected namespace
  - Chat persistence across navigation (localStorage via zustand persist)
  - Copy button and timestamps on all messages

- **Pulse Agent backend** ([pulse-agent](https://github.com/alimobrem/pulse-agent)) — 54 tools:
  - 39 read diagnostics: pods, nodes, deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, Ingresses, Routes, HPAs, PDBs, LimitRanges, ReplicaSets, services (with endpoints), TLS certificates, operator subscriptions
  - Prometheus/PromQL queries via Thanos, Alertmanager alert triage
  - `top_pods_by_restarts`, `get_recent_changes` convenience tools
  - 9 write operations: scale, restart, cordon, uncordon, delete pod, rollback deployment, drain node, apply YAML (server-side apply with dry-run), create network policy (with dry-run)

- **SECURITY.md** — Comprehensive security documentation (model, audit, RBAC, hardening, checklist)
- **GitOps config tab** in Admin view for configuring Git provider, repo, and token

### Changed
- **Typed K8s interfaces** — 50+ interfaces in `engine/types/`, reduced `as any` from 179 to 5 (97%)
- **AdminView split** — 1412→488 lines, extracted OverviewTab, OperatorsTab, UpdatesTab, SnapshotsTab
- **CSS cleanup** — Removed dead PatternFly deps (4 packages), centralized chart colors (`engine/colors.ts`), Card primitive adopted (89 replacements), terminal theme extracted to CSS variables

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **HyperShift / Hosted Control Plane support** — Auto-detects hosted clusters via Infrastructure resource (`controlPlaneTopology: External`). Adapts health checks, production readiness, and compute view for hosted control plane model.
- **Persistent topology badge** — "Hosted" pill in CommandBar visible on every view when running on a HyperShift cluster.
- **"Hosted Control Plane" badge** on Pulse daily briefing with tooltip explaining the hosting model.
- **Control Plane InfoCard** in Admin overview showing topology type (Hosted/Self-managed) and API server URL.
- **Snapshot topology tracking** — `controlPlaneTopology` captured in cluster snapshots and included in diff comparisons.
- **Prerequisites section** in README with OCP, Node.js, oc CLI, and browser requirements.

### Changed
- **Health checks adapted for HyperShift** — HA Control Plane, MachineHealthChecks, and Cluster Autoscaling checks skip on hosted clusters (irrelevant when CP is external). Production Readiness shows "Hosted Control Plane: Managed externally" as auto-pass.
- **Etcd backup check** auto-passes on HyperShift with "Managed by hosting provider" instead of SSH backup instructions.
- **Worker Nodes check** threshold adjusted to 1+ on HyperShift (vs 2+ on traditional) since all nodes are workers.
- **Machine Management section** hidden on HyperShift ComputeView with info block explaining NodePool model.
- **Machine API queries gated** — Machines, MachineSets, MachineHealthChecks, MachineAutoscalers, and ClusterAutoscaler queries disabled on HyperShift clusters (`enabled: !isHyperShift`) to avoid unnecessary API calls.
- **AdminView** unified to read `isHyperShift` from `useClusterStore` instead of deriving locally, matching all other views.
- **Create button hidden** for Nodes in resource browser (nodes are provisioned via MachineSet/NodePool, not created directly).
- **README rewritten** — Added 10 previously undocumented features, fixed stale test/health check counts, added all keyboard shortcuts, added prerequisites section.

### Fixed
- Control plane operator list on Pulse no longer shows missing operators as broken on HyperShift — only shows operators that actually exist in the cluster.
- Health check count corrected from 67 to 76 (Security view's 9 checks were previously uncounted).

### Stats
- **1162 tests** across 63 test files (up from 1128/61 in v4.0.0)
- **76 health checks** (31 cluster + 45 domain)
- **13 views**, 35 routes
- Build time: ~1s (Rspack)
